## Declarative dotfiles configuration using Nix Darwin and Home Manager **(Always WIP)**

### TLDR

This config exists because I was tired of:
- Opening a new laptop/machine and spending a whole day setting it up
- Having different versions of dotfiles scattered everywhere
- Forgetting what I installed or changed on my machine
- Trying to remember "what was that package again?"
- Making things work on one machine but break on another
- Having my work and personal setups drift apart

So I made this. It's basically my entire system written in Nix - one config that:
- Sets up everything the same way, every time
- Works on all my Macs (it's Darwin/macOS focused, but you can tweak it for other systems)
- Keeps my work and personal setups in sync, but separate when needed

## 📋 Features

- 🛠 Development environments for multiple languages
- 💻 Go, Python, Rust, Lua, PHP, Node.js, Nix
- 📝 Extensive Neovim configuration with LSP support (NixVim)
- 🐟 Fish shell with custom configuration
- 🔐 Secure secret management with sops-nix
- 📦 Reproducible package management
- 🖥️ Cross-machine configuration (work/personal)
- 🪟 macOS window management with Yabai and SKHD
- 🎨 Custom status bar with SketchyBar **WIP**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Nix

This command installs the Nix package manager based on the [DeterminateSystem/nix-installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer), based on the explanation by the [Zero to Nix](https://zero-to-nix.com/), it gives better error messages, an installation plan (like Terraform), and other cool features that bring a better installation experience for you.

Just follow the step by step of the installation flow and everything will be fine.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

After installation, restart your terminal.

### 2. Enable Nix Flakes

Create or edit `~/.config/nix/nix.conf`:

```bash
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
```

### 3. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ervan0707/cosmic.git
cd cosmic
```

### 4. Set Up Age Keys for Secret Management

#### Important Note ⚠️
When using SSH keys to generate age keys, only Ed25519 keys are supported. RSA or other key types are not compatible.

Generate a new age key (Option 1):
```bash
# Create directory for age keys
mkdir -p ~/.config/sops/age

# Generate new key
nix shell nixpkgs#age -c age-keygen -o ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt
```

Generate from existing SSH key (Option 2 - Only for Ed25519):
```bash
# Ensure you're using an Ed25519 key
# Your SSH key should look like this when you cat it:
# -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
# ... (key contents)
# -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
# The public key should start with 'ssh-ed25519'

# Convert Ed25519 SSH key to age key
nix run nixpkgs#ssh-to-age -- -private-key -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 > ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt

# If you don't have an Ed25519 key, create one:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Get the public key for .sops.yaml:
```bash
nix shell nixpkgs#age -c age-keygen -y ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt
```

The output will look something like:
```
age1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Update `.sops.yaml` with your public key:
```yaml
keys:
  - &personal age1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  # your public key here
```

Test your setup:
```bash
# Try to view encrypted secrets (Note: You won't be able to decrypt existing secrets)
SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt sops -d secrets/personal.yaml

# Create new encrypted secrets with your key
SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt sops secrets/personal.yaml
```

The existing encrypted secrets in this repository are encrypted with a different key, so you'll need to create your own encrypted secrets. The default template includes:

```yaml
github_token: "your-github-token"
codestats_api_key: "your-codestats-api-key"
email: "your-email"
username: "your-username"
```

After saving, your secrets will be encrypted with your key and can be safely committed to the repository.

Remember to create both `personal.yaml` and `work.yaml` if you're using both configurations.

### 5. Configure Your Environment

Edit the following files according to your needs:
- `lib/utils.nix`: Update system configurations
- `secrets/personal.yaml`: Personal secrets
- `secrets/work.yaml`: Work-related secrets

### 6. Deploy Configuration

#### Option A: Full System Configuration (recommended for macOS)

This includes both nix-darwin (system configuration) and home-manager:
```bash
# For work setup
nix build .#darwinConfigurations.work.system
./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#work

# For personal setup
nix build .#darwinConfigurations.personal.system
./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#personal
```

After the initial build, you can use the shorter form:
```bash
darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#work  # or .#personal
```

#### Option B: Home Manager Only (for non-system configuration)

If you only want to manage user-level configuration without system modifications:
```bash
# For work setup
nix build .#homeConfigurations.work.activationPackage
./result/activate

# For personal setup
nix build .#homeConfigurations.personal.activationPackage
./result/activate
```

**Note:** Using nix-darwin (Option A) is recommended for macOS as it provides:
- System-level configuration (keyboard, dock, etc.)
- Window management with Yabai
- Custom status bar with SketchyBar
- Keyboard shortcuts with SKHD
- Touch ID integration
- System-wide package management

Choose Option B if you:
- Only need user-level configuration
- Are using a non-macOS system
- Don't want to modify system settings
- Need a more portable configuration

## 💻 Development Shells

Enter different development environments:

```bash
# Full development environment
nix develop .

# Language-specific environments
nix develop .#go
nix develop .#python
nix develop .#rust
nix develop .#lua
nix develop .#php
nix develop .#node
nix develop .#nix
```


## 🛠️ Neovim Configuration

The Neovim configuration includes:
- LSP support for multiple languages
- Code completion with nvim-cmp
- Telescope for fuzzy finding
- Git integration with gitsigns
- File explorer with nvim-tree
- Beautiful UI with Gruvbox themes
- Custom keybindings with which-key

Access Neovim:
```bash
# Use the configured Neovim
nix run .#nixvim
```

## 📦 Updating Dependencies

Update Nix flake inputs:
```bash
nix flake update
```

## 🎯 Quick Run Cheatsheet

Run configurations directly from GitHub without cloning:

### 🏃‍♂️ Direct From GitHub
```bash
# Run Neovim configuration
nix run github:Ervan0707/cosmic#nixvim

# Build and activate complete configuration (includes both nix-darwin and home-manager)
nix build github:Ervan0707/cosmic#darwinConfigurations.work.system
./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake github:Ervan0707/cosmic#work

nix build github:Ervan0707/cosmic#darwinConfigurations.personal.system
./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake github:Ervan0707/cosmic#personal

# For non-macOS systems only: build home-manager configuration
nix build github:Ervan0707/cosmic#homeConfigurations.work.activationPackage
nix build github:Ervan0707/cosmic#homeConfigurations.personal.activationPackage
```

> **Note:** For macOS users, use the nix-darwin configurations as they automatically include home-manager settings. The home-manager only configurations are provided separately for non-macOS systems or special use cases.



**Note:** After activating nix-darwin and home-manager configurations, your system will inherit:

**System Level (nix-darwin):**
- 🪟 Yabai window management
- ⌨️ SKHD keyboard shortcuts
- 📊 SketchyBar
- 🔒 Touch ID for sudo authentication

- 🔐 Decrypted secrets as environment variables
- 🔧 Git with separate work/personal profiles
- 📝 Development tools and language servers
- ⌨️ Tmux with custom configuration
- 🚀 Neovim with full IDE setup
- 📦 User-specific packages

**Development Environments:**
- 💻 Language-specific toolchains
- 🛠️ Project-specific dependencies
- 🔍 LSP and debugging tools
